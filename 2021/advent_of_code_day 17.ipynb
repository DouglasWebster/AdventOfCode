    "\n",
    "The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any [integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.\n",

    "The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in **steps**. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.\n",
    "- The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.\n",
    "- Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.\n",
    "- Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a **target area** after any step. The submarine computer has already calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5`\n",

    "This target area means that you need to find initial x,y velocity values such that after any step, the probe's x position is at least 20 and at most 30, and the probe's y position is at least -10 and at most -5.\n",

Starting with the maximum positive velocity that will not overshoot the target area (1 less than the distance to the lower y bound) fire a test shot and see how man steps are within the target area then store the steps and the velocity.\n",
